<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catcher, a mobile application designed to make the act of fishing interesting, rewarding, and challenging among peers. This application will help users to log the fish caught and suggest to the user the type of fish they have caught. It will award users with a point based on the fish features they catch and allows the users to compete with their peers for points. While fishing is fun for many reasons, this application will help you connect with your friends and family and reward you with points so that you can challenge and compete with your social groups.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no correct way to fish, but you can always talk to others about what works most of the time. There are many components when fishing. To name a few, there are techniques, rods, reels, and lures. The way a lure is handled in the water is technique. Rods vary in length, materials, and price. Reels vary in strength and size, as well as materials. Lures vary in actions. For example, some lures spin as you reel them in, whereas others imitate a fish's swimming motion. Additionally, some lures require different techniques. Some lures must be constantly reeled in, while others can sit on the bottom of the body of water. By creating an app, we provide all this information in one spot, relieving the user from hours of internet searching. And by collecting fishing data from the user, we can provide new users with information that will help them discover different and better ways to fish. After catching a fish, the fish can be logged into the app to keep track of crucial information, such as the type of fish, the size, the weather, and the location. Information kept will provide insight into how and when to attempt fishing in the future. When learning a new skill, it is easy to quit, especially if you do not know anyone who shares the same hobby. By creating a competitive environment, the user will be motivated to continue fishing and using the app to challenge others. Normally, the only competition is to catch a bigger fish than the biggest catch. With this app, users can compete against themselves, friends, or strangers. By using a point-based system with the fish that they caught, they will be entertained via competing. Anyone can fish. By having the basic tools, starting fishermen can catch the same fish as experienced fishermen. Unlike ours, many applications require the user to purchase a plan to access features that can be useful to the user, which may cause them to quit. Many beginners quit when they fail. Failure mostly has a higher chance of occurring when learning how to start. With this application, features will be available to beginners. This app will be a helping hand to get them started with fishing. They can build a fishing community through the app, which they can use to meet other fishers, learn more about fishing, and see trends about what works for them.</p>

<h2><strong>Project Requirements</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the list of top requirements that are of highest priority for the application:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Firstly, the users of the application should have a mobile device that has cellular network connectivity or Wi-Fi, and a camera.</li><li>The users must allow access to the media Library, location access, and camera for the application to upload, take, or select a picture, and get weather information.&nbsp;</li><li>The online Firebase Database, AWS console, Weather, and Map API’s must be operational at all times.</li><li>The users of the application must create an account to utilize the features of the application.</li><li>The online Firebase Database must maintain an accurate record of all the user credentials and their uploads.&nbsp;</li><li>The cloud image processing must be able to get all the required data from the application sensors and analyze data to predict the type of fish caught.</li><li>The application must display State rules and regulations for fishing.</li><li>The application must display nearby fishing supply stores.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>System Overview</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Catcher mobile application will consist of three main layers described as Web Layer, Data Processing Layer, and Input/Output Layer. The Web Layer consists of a database that will record all the user information and their activity log such as their scores and pictures they have uploaded. The Data Processing Layer is the backend of the Catcher Application on the user's device. The Input/Output layer provides an interface between the app and the device such as various sensors and will also handle interactions with APIs.&nbsp;</p>
